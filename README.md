Inspiration:

Harness the power of machine learning and the organization of Notion to combat climate change. Our solution predicts future CO2 trends, transforming complex data into clear visualizations presented directly within your Notion workspace. Centralize climate insights seamlessly with your notes, planning, and research. CliML empowers informed, data-driven action to drive a more sustainable future.

What it does:

Our program uses a dataset linearly interpolated using data on the United States from 2012 to 2022. Implementing machine learning through linear regression to predict trends of CO2 emission and sea level changes in the next 10 years. These predictions will be able to help decision making processes related to climate change.

Challenges we ran into:

Throughout our project journey, we encountered several challenges, with the most significant one revolving around seamlessly integrating our code with the Notion API. While we successfully managed minor issues like properly reading the file and sorting the data, the integration process posed a substantial hurdle.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

We are proud that we were able to work as a team to integrate our machine learning model into Notion API and properly use data to project much further into the future.

What we learned:

Through this process, we learned how to take data sets, use Notion API, and use a variety of techniques in order to properly project future changes in sea level and CO2 emissions.

What's next for CliML: CO2 Predictions with Machine Learning & Notion API:

Though we weren't able to optimize and present our findings in a way we were fully satisfied with due to the time constraints of the hackathon, we will continue to optimize our machine learning model and hope to finish it in the future
